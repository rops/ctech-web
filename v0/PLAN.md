# CTech Website — Plan & Status

## Current State

The site is fully built and deployed at https://rops.github.io/ctech-web/. All 13 pages are live. Two rounds of development and fixes are complete (latest commit: `97860cb`).

## Awaiting User Review

The user is reviewing the live site and will provide feedback. Next steps depend on that feedback.

## Known Open Items

1. **No favicon.ico** — currently using the 110x80 PNG logo (blurry in browser tabs)
2. **`materiali/` folder publicly exposed** on GitHub Pages — should be gitignored or removed
3. **No real team/office photos** — stock photos as placeholders
4. **No testimonials or case studies**
5. **ESET SVG is hand-drawn** — looks decent but not the official vector logo
6. **WinWaste homepage image is portrait (861x1080)** — may look odd in side-by-side layout
7. **Arca screenshot is tiny** (7.5KB WebP) — may look low-quality at larger sizes
8. **B.Point and Genya pages** weren't reviewed in the last feedback round
9. **Mobile testing** not done
10. **No sitemap.xml or robots.txt**
11. **Unused PNG icon files** in `assets/img/icon/` could be cleaned up
12. **User has .ai logo file** but hasn't provided SVG export
13. **Temp files at repo root** (`winwaste-full.png`, `winwaste-rentri.png`) should be removed
